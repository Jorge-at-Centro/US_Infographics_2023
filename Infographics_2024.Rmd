#This project is a step by step process to getting U.S. Census data, #accompanying boundary files,
#displaying them geographically, and #creating #visualizations for CENTRO published infographics.

#We will start by calling the necesarry libraries to perform all #operations.

```{r Call libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#We first install the package {pacman} if necessary. This package allows the 
#user to load and install packages in a more streamlined manner.

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

               tidycensus,      #To handle Census data.
               sf,              #To handle spatial data.
               tmap,            #To visualize spatial data.
               leaflet,         #in case we wanted to do interactive maps
               stringr,         #To do some string manipulation.
               tigris,          #To do some spatial data manipulation.
               grid)            #To do some visualization

#We are also going to give the program the instruction to avoid using scientific
#notation when generating calculations.
options(scipen=999)
```

#The first step in our analysis is gathering the data we need to produce the #visualizations.

#In 2023, there were 15 states for wich Puerto Rican population data was #available based on the 65k
#threshhold the U.S. Census establishes for reporting #information. These were: California,
#Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, #Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North
#Carolina, Ohio, #Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, adn Wisconsin.

#We will use the "get_acs" function from the {tydcensus} package to get Puerto #Rican population
#data for each of the states listed above. Additionally we will #gather information on the Hispanic
#population since we will also be visualazing #this group in a select number of states.

```{r PR pop by county by state, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

#First we create a list containing the abbreviations of all the states of
#interest. This will serve for us to loop through and create new data frames 
#for each state.

#In the previous chunk, we obtained data for the PR adn Hispanic population for
#selected states. In the code, lines were included to clean the names of the 
#counties to ease readability when inserting labels into future visualizations.
#This works relatively well for all states except Connecticut, who switched from 
#its 8 historic counties to 9 "planning regions". We need to do some extra steps
#to clean the names in this state.
